/*
Given a bitonic array find the maximum value of the array.
An array is said to be bitonic if it has an increasing sequence
of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers.

Ex:- 
input:- arr[] = {1,4,8,3,2}
output:- 8   
Diagram:- Bitonic array  [inc,peak,dec]
              peak
               / \
              /   \
             /     \
            /       \
Logic:- find peak elment that will give you maximum element in bitonic array
see Question 13
